# HEAL CONNECT - Complete Replit to GitHub Migration Instructions

## THAENOS Systems Migration Protocol v25.0.400

### Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Personal Access Token**
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Select scopes: `repo`, `workflow`, `write:packages`
   - Copy the generated token (save it securely)

2. **GitHub Account Setup**
   - Ensure you have a GitHub account
   - Know your exact GitHub username

### Migration Process

#### Step 1: Run the Migration Script
```bash
./export-to-github.sh
```

The script will:
- âœ… Check all prerequisites
- âœ… Create a complete backup of your project
- âœ… Initialize Git repository with proper configuration
- âœ… Create comprehensive .gitignore for all file types
- âœ… Generate detailed README.md with full documentation
- âœ… Set up environment template (.env.example)
- âœ… Create initial commit with all project files
- âœ… Create GitHub repository via API
- âœ… Push all code to GitHub
- âœ… Set up development and staging branches
- âœ… Verify the migration was successful

#### Step 2: Local Development Setup
After migration, to work locally:

```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git
cd REPO-NAME

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual values

# Start development
npm run dev
```

### What's Included in Migration

#### Complete Project Structure
- âœ… All source code files (`client/`, `server/`, `shared/`)
- âœ… Configuration files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`)
- âœ… Database schema and migrations
- âœ… All assets and static files
- âœ… Hidden system files (when necessary)
- âœ… Node modules dependencies list

#### Enhanced Documentation
- âœ… Comprehensive README.md with setup instructions
- âœ… API documentation with all endpoints
- âœ… Architecture overview and technology stack
- âœ… Development guidelines and best practices
- âœ… Deployment instructions for multiple environments

#### Git Configuration
- âœ… Proper .gitignore excluding unnecessary files
- âœ… Clean commit history starting with migration
- âœ… Multiple branches (main, development, staging)
- âœ… Remote origin properly configured

#### Environment Setup
- âœ… .env.example template with all required variables
- âœ… Database configuration examples
- âœ… API key placeholders
- âœ… Development vs production settings

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Authentication Failed**
   ```bash
   # Ensure your GitHub token has correct permissions
   # Re-run script with correct token
   ```

2. **Repository Already Exists**
   ```bash
   # Script handles this gracefully
   # Will attempt to use existing repository
   ```

3. **Permission Denied**
   ```bash
   # Make script executable
   chmod +x export-to-github.sh
   ```

4. **Git Not Found**
   ```bash
   # Install Git first
   sudo apt-get install git  # Ubuntu/Debian
   brew install git          # macOS
   ```

### Verification Steps

After migration, verify:

1. **Repository Exists**: Visit `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME`
2. **All Files Present**: Check that all your project files are visible
3. **Branches Created**: Confirm main, development, and staging branches exist
4. **Clone Test**: Try cloning the repository locally
5. **Build Test**: Run `npm install && npm run build` to ensure it works

### Post-Migration Actions

#### Immediate Steps
1. âœ… Update repository description and topics on GitHub
2. âœ… Set up branch protection rules if desired
3. âœ… Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD (optional)
4. âœ… Add collaborators if working in a team

#### Development Workflow
1. âœ… Work on `development` branch for new features
2. âœ… Use `staging` branch for testing
3. âœ… Merge to `main` for production releases
4. âœ… Tag releases for version tracking

### Support & Assistance

If you encounter any issues during migration:

1. **Check the migration log**: `migration-success.log`
2. **Refer to backup**: Backup is automatically created before migration
3. **Manual steps**: Script provides manual commands if automation fails
4. **Re-run script**: Safe to run multiple times

### Security Considerations

- âœ… GitHub token is only used during migration (not stored)
- âœ… Sensitive files excluded via .gitignore
- âœ… Environment variables template provided (no actual secrets)
- âœ… Database credentials not included in repository
