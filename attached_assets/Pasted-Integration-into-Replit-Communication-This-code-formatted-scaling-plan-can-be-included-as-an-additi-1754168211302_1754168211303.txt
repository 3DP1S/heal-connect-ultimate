Integration into Replit Communication
This code-formatted scaling plan can be included as an additional attachment or embedded within the body of a follow-up email to Replit’s enterprise sales team (sales@replit.com). It complements the existing proposal, technical specifications, and demo strategy by providing a forward-looking roadmap of our scaling ambitions and specific infrastructure requirements. I recommend attaching it as a file named Scaling_Instructions_Phase3_Phase4.md with a brief mention in the email body, such as:

Email Addition:

"We have also attached a detailed scaling plan (Scaling_Instructions_Phase3_Phase4.md) formatted for technical clarity, outlining Phases 3 and 4 of our roadmap, including timelines, objectives, and infrastructure needs where Replit’s expertise would be invaluable."
